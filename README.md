# Shiny-Take-Away

This Shiny App allows the user to study and observe different worldwide football player stats, 
obtained and assigned by the FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association).

It will be composed by 4 interactive and different pages:

  1. PLAYERS RATING
    This first page allows to observe the player's Overall Rating is assigned in terms of
    different stats that you can choose from the left panel, as could be the speed, 
    ball control or player's price, among others. 
    Additionally, if you click over a data point (each data point is in fact a player), you
    can obtain further information about him/her.
    
  2. PLAYERS STATS
    This second page, similar to the previous one, let the user observe different physical and technical
    stats, that the user can select, just in terms of their position, in order to be able to
    better understand which player position usually shows better performances among certain stat.
    
  3. PRICE CALCULATOR
    This third page allows the user to compute and estimate a player's signing price according
    to some (chosen and tunned) characteristics and stats. So for example, if the user wanted to sign
    a very young, fast and dribbling skilled player, he could tune up those stats (right panel) and
    therefor estimate his/her market price. In the tabpanel next to it (Model Summary) we can 
    observe with further detail the linear model used to estimate the player's price.
    
  4. TOP PLAYERS
    In this last page, the user can observe a Ranking of Top (10, 25, 50, 100) Players according to the main feature 
    we want to rank them. We can rank them by clicking over the column name (once to see the Bottom ones and double 
    click for the Top ones according that variable). Additionally, there is a search tab in which you can 
    search about a specific player, team or even nationalities, in order to visualize and have 
    an overall idea of which players and from which clubs are the best ones according some characteristics or 
    stats.
