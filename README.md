# Shiny-Take-Away

This Shiny App allows the user to study and observe different worldwide football player stats, 
obtained and assigned by the FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association).

It will be composed by 4 interactive and different pages:

  1. PLAYERS RATING
    This first page allows to observe the player's Overall Rating is assigned in terms of
    different stats that you can choose from the right panel, as could be the finishing skills, 
    ball control or player's speed, among others. It can also be viewed below four boxplots according 
    to the selected feature/stat by each player position, in order to be able to
    better understand which player position usually shows better performances among certain stat.
    Additionally, if you pass over a data point (each data point is in fact a player), you
    can obtain further information about him.
  
  2. PRICE CALCULATOR
    This second page allows the user to compute and estimate a player's signing price according
    to some (chosen and tunned) characteristics and stats. So for example, if the user wanted to sign
    a very young, fast and dribbling skilled player, he could tune up those stats (right panel) and
    therefor estimate his/her market price. The user can also download a report of these settings and 
    final signing price by clicking on the download button at the right bottom.
    In the tabpanel next to it (Model Summary) we can observe with further detail the linear model
    used to estimate the player's price.
  
  3. PLAYERS WAGE
    This third page, we can make observations about the monthly wages a specific player earns, by
    clicking over any of the green points (each one is, in fact, a player). In order to visualize better and
    more sepparately the data points, the user can filter in the left panel by player position, 
    so a studies of, for example, position-wage trends can also be performed.
    
  4. TOP PLAYERS
    In this last page, the user can observe a Ranking of Top (10, 25, 50, 100) Players according to the main feature 
    we want to rank them. We can rank them by clicking over the column name (once to see the Bottom ones and double 
    click for the Top ones according that variable). Additionally, there is a search tab in which you can 
    search about a specific player, team or even nationalities, in order to visualize and have 
    an overall idea of which players and from which clubs are the best ones according some characteristics or 
    stats.
